## Dockerfiles repository

This repo contains several dockerfiles for some services I needed under an Archlinux base.
Some folders contains Dockerfiles with -rpi extension. It means that it's intended to be used with a RaspberryPi.
Those dockerfiles can be used for any ARMv7 Hard Float platform.

The archlinux dockerfile uses an ArchlinuxARM archive that isn't committed in my repo, you can found it here :
[Archlinux ARM](http://archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz)

All my RaspberryPi Dockerfiles uses my archlinux container as base but you can use them in any archlinux based container
